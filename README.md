# Foundation Components for MLOps Systems

Arm provides a set of foundation tools and software components to enable MLOps systems and the overall development flow for machine learning applications. 
This repository contains:

- Setup of a Docker container with foundation tools for MLOps systems.
- A template project `MLOps.csolution.yml`. It uses a compiler to create a library with a trained ML model. The ML model performance is measured using Arm Virtual Hardware (AVH) FVP Models. 
- An example that shows the usage of the foundation components.
 
Refer to the [**Cortex-M and Ethos-U ML Developer Guide**](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/109267/latest/) for more information.

## Arm Tools Artifactory

To facilitate tool integration Arm provides critical foundation tools in a tools artifactory. The following tools are installed in the Docker container. In addition utilities such as CMake are installed.
